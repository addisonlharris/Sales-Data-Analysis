# Sales Data Analysis
 Use pandas to analyze sales trends, seasonality, and product performance.

This sales analysis project was built using a Kaggle dataset, python pandas, matplotlib and our main goals of this project was to:

1. Find out is what was the best month for sales and how much was earned in revenue that month

2. we want to find out what city has the highest number of sales

3. what product was often sold together

4. what product was sold the most and why do we think it was sold the most

To answer our first question we began by reading in the CSV and setting it as a dataframe. We then grouped our months data to sum how much in sales were generated each month.

To answer our second question we then grouped our cities data to sum how much in sales were generated by each city.

To answer our third question we performed some data transformation to reveal which products were sold together the most. We first grouped the order ID's & products to determine which products were the most bought together. We then dropped the duplicated order ID's to see our final results of items bought together without repeated order ID's. Because of the large dataset I decided to only show the top 10 most sold together items

To finally answer our fourth question we summed the total number of products sold by quantity ordered.![Uploading Most Sold Product This Year.pngâ€¦]()
